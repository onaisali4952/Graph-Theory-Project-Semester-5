# Graph-Theory-Project-Semester-5
Worked on by Onais Ali Shah and Zohaib Saqib

File A invloves 4 low level problems
  1) Draw a simple graph
  2) Generate a complete graph
  3) Create bipartite and tripartite graphs
  4) Apply Havel-Hakimi Theorem for a simple graph

File B involves work on three algorithms
  1) BFS
  2) DFS
  3) Augmenting Flow Algorithm

The attached powerpoint holds research into real world applications of the three algorithms from part B
